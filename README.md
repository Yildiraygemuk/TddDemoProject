<h2>What is Test Driven Development (TDD)</h2>
</br>

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach in which test cases are developed to determine and validate what the code will do.
The advantages of the TDD approach include faster feedback, higher acceptance rate, lower project scope and over-engineering, 
customer-centric and iterative processes, modular, flexible and maintainable code.

Test-driven development refers to a style of programming in which coding, testing, and design work together.
In simple terms, test cases are created and tested for each function first. If the test fails at this stage, 
the code is rewritten to pass the test and make the code simple and error-free.

<h2>TDD Advantages</h2>
</br>
TDD avoids the programmer's "maybe it will be used in the future, it's worth adding this method" thinking. In this way, TDD reduces the cost of the project.

With TDD, the test coverage is quite wide.

Tests increase confidence in the code.

Tests can be thought of as documentation showing how the system works.

It brings the design first mentality and allows us to avoid over-engineering.
